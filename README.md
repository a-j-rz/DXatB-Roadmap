DXatB Roadmap

A fully interactive, D3.js-powered strategic roadmap visualisation

This repository contains an interactive strategic roadmap visualisation built with D3.js, 
designed to communicate multi-year evolution across key domains, platforms, and thematic phases.

The visual supports executive storytelling, transformation planning, and portfolio orchestration.

It renders dynamic SVG elements, milestone timelines, domain clusters, and multi-mode reveal states.
